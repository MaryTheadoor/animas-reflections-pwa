# Development Log — Animas Reflections PWA

A chronological record of all development sessions, decisions, and state changes.
Purpose: restore full context in any new terminal instance.

---

## Session 1 — 2026-06-16 | 18:15 MST

### Context Restored From
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — recovery blueprint
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system overview
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` — commands and conventions
- `docs/SCHEMA.md` — data model
- `Downloads/animas_reflections_scope_roadmap.md` — original engineering spec

### Actions Taken
1. **Full project analysis** — catalogued all 87+ source files, 18 routes, 16+ Cloud Functions, 6 Firestore collections, 4 test suites
2. **Backup framework established** (3-layer redundancy):
   - Created `scripts/backup-file.ps1` — pre-edit file snapshot to `_backups/` + redundant local disk
   - Created `scripts/backup-commit.ps1` — git add → commit → push to GitHub → redundant local copy
   - Created `scripts/snapshot-full.ps1` — full project snapshot (excludes node_modules/.next/out)
   - Created `scripts/restore.ps1` — browse + restore from any backup point
   - Added 5 npm scripts: `backup:file`, `backup:commit`, `backup:snapshot`, `backup:list`, `backup:restore`
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `_backups/`
   - Redundant local path: `C:\Users\AmosA\Backups\animas-reflections-pwa\`
3. **Master scope document** — created `docs/SCOPE.md` v1.0 synthesizing external roadmap, Square site copy, current codebase state, and stated requirements
4. **This devlog initiated** — `docs/DEVLOG.md`

### Key State at Session Start
- `USE_SYNTHETIC = true` in `src/hooks/useCatalog.ts`
- Working tree clean, on `master`, up to date with `origin/master`
- Firebase fully configured (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Hosting)
- Last commit before session: `bc8f580` — "fix: restore err in saveAddress catch block"
